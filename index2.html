            <h4 class ="about_text">Nowadays, hackathons are rampant with negative influences. Whether it be cheating, bad judging, horrible mentors, or an uncomfortable venue, it's hard to perform your best at hackathons lately. That's where we come in. After months of attending various hackathons and surveying the attendees, we're ready to present a hackathon that allows the competitive coder in you to roam free.</h3>

                      <p class="about_body">Unlike other hackathons, here at ProHacks, we have a group of volunteers at the ready checking people's code every 2 hours on GitHub, with participants required to submit commits to their code on a per hour basis. Despite its inconveniences, this way we can assure that everybody has a fair shot.</p>

                      <p class="about_body">From the coding range to the food options, we've gone out of our way to ensure that every Pro Hacker has the best experience possible, and that all starts with a wide variety of options to choose from. Here at ProHacks, you can, hopefully, find what you like in the food, and make what you want in the code.</p>

In addition to that, we will be providing some miscellaneous resources for Pro Hackers to accelerate their development. More details will be released as organization progresses.</p>
